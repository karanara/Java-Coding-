1.Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
2.Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation. Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
3.Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
For example,"egg" and "add" are isomorphic, "foo" and "bar" are not.
